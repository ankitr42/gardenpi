# GardenPI - GardenPI loves plants!

GardenPI is an automated watering system for your garden. It can take care of your plants when you can't. It has a web interface to let you remotely control and observe. It runs on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi. Even a Pi Zero has more than enough power to run GardenPI.
